#  Address Book – C Programming Project

##  Project Overview

Address Book is a modular, menu-driven console application developed in C that enables users to manage contacts efficiently.  
The system supports full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) along with input validation and persistent storage using file handling.
The application loads existing contacts at startup and saves them to a structured text file, ensuring data persistence across executions.
